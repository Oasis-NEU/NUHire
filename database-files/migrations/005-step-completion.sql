-- 005: durable per-student step completion, so the group barrier survives a
-- restart.
--
-- The "has every group member finished?" barrier lived in
-- `global.completedResReview`, a plain object in the API process. Every way out
-- of it was a permanent stuck, and each has happened in a live class:
--
--   * API restart  -> the object is gone. Students who already finished never
--                     re-emit, so the count restarts at 0 and can never reach
--                     the group total. The whole group waits forever.
--   * reconnect    -> the handler identified the student by reverse-lookup in
--                     another in-memory map, which a reconnected socket is no
--                     longer in, so the completion was dropped silently.
--   * one-shot     -> the release was emitted to a cached socket id and the key
--                     deleted. A student offline at that instant never got it
--                     and there was no retry.
--
-- With the rows here the barrier is a query, so it can be re-evaluated as often
-- as anyone asks: on completion, on room join, on a roster change, and from the
-- GET /groups/barrier-status poll.
--
-- NOT destructive: this only adds a table and backfills it. No existing row is
-- modified or deleted.
--
-- Safe to run twice: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is a no-op the second time and
-- the backfill is INSERT IGNORE against the primary key below, so a second run
-- inserts nothing.
