-- 001: one vote row per student per resume.
--
-- `Resume` had only PRIMARY KEY (id) and a non-unique KEY on student_id. Both
-- writers in resume.controller.ts use ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, which needs a
-- unique key to fire, so it never did: every submission appended a row and
-- res-review-group counted all of them. A student who changed an answer, or
-- whose client retried, was counted twice in their group's tally.
--
-- DESTRUCTIVE. The dedupe below deletes duplicate vote rows, keeping the
-- highest id for each (student_id, group_id, class, resume_number) — the most
-- recent submission, which is the one the student meant. Take a backup first:
--
--   mysqldump -h <host> -u <user> -p <database> Resume > Resume-backup.sql
--
-- Safe to run twice: the dedupe is a no-op once there are no duplicates, and
-- the ALTER is skipped if the key already exists.

-- How many rows this is about to remove. Run on its own first if you want to
-- see the damage before committing to it.
