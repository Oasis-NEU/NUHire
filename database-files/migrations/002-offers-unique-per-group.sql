-- 002: one offer row per group per class.
--
-- `Offers` had only PRIMARY KEY (id). A group submits one offer, but two members
-- clicking submit in the same second inserted two pending rows, and the
-- professor's pending-offers list showed that group twice. Accepting one left
-- the other pending for the rest of the class, and `makeOffer` picks whichever
-- row the API returns first, so the group could see an offer the professor
-- never acted on. The client-side guard is fixed; this is the server side.
--
-- With the unique key in place, createOffer in offer.controller.ts becomes an
-- upsert, so a duplicate click lands on the row that is already there.
--
-- DESTRUCTIVE. The dedupe below deletes duplicate offer rows. For each
-- (class_id, group_id) it keeps the row the professor most likely acted on:
-- an `accepted` row first, then `pending`, then `rejected`, and within the
-- same status the highest id — the most recent submission. Take a backup first:
--
--   mysqldump -h <host> -u <user> -p <database> Offers > Offers-backup.sql
--
-- Safe to run twice: the dedupe is a no-op once there are no duplicates, and
-- the ALTER is skipped if the key already exists.

-- How many rows this is about to remove. Run on its own first if you want to
-- see the damage before committing to it. A row is doomed when some other row
-- for the same (class_id, group_id) outranks it on (status, then newest).
